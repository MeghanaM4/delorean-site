your guide to all the parts of a nixie clock

## Nixie Tubes

Nixie tubes are a glass tube filled with low pressure neon gas (and a bit of argon) that have a bunch of metal
numbers inside.

Each of these numbers is a **cathode**, which electrons flow into when voltage is applied. Each tube has 10
cathodes (one for each digit, 0-9), and one anode. The cathode is the positive end and the anode is the negative 
end. One number is activated at a time (or else everything would be jumbled), so at any given time the circuit
is complete.

When you put voltage into the cathode, the whole thing glows because the gas is ionized. Nixie tubes aren't
like those old-timey incandescent bulbs that get so hot that they glow, they're called *cold cathode* lights.

TLDR, a nixie tube is a tube filled with gas that shows glowy numbers when you apply voltage

## K155ID1 Driver Chip
So Nixie tubes are hard to control. That's why people build driver chips, to help ***drive*** (control) stuff
for us. There are driver chips for OLED displays, for 7 segment displays, LED matrixes, and a bunch more. The
K155ID1 chip is just the driver chip made to control nixie tubes.

With this tiny rectangle it's so much easier to code our tube and make it look cool. We don't have to worry
about a whole load of nastiness that comes with using Soviet-era tech.

TLDR, the driver chip is what lets us control the nixie tubes

## 5V-9V to 170V Boost Converter
To function, IN-12 Nixie tubes need ~170V. Surprisingly, setting up 114 AA batteries is not the most efficient
way to achieve this. There are these neat things called **boost converters** which can (you guessed it) boost
voltage from a reasonable amount, like 5V, to an insane amount, or 170V.

Electrically, there's an inductor inside the boost converter. INSERT TECHNICAL EXPLANATION

TLDR, the boost converter cranks up our computer's power to the amount a nixie tube needs

## Raspberry Pi Pico W
You may have heard of Raspberry Pis before (spoiler: they're not food), and they're what's called a 
**microcontoller**-- basically just a mini computer.

They can process data and information with the chips they have on board, which act like their brains (the chip 
is usually the big black square). The chip on the pico W is the RP2040. There are a ton of different
chips, all with their own features and pros and cons.

We're using the pico W because it's small (pico) and because it's Wifi-enabled (that's the W
part). So it won't take up too much space and we can connect to the internet to sync our clocks.

TLDR, the pico W is the brains of the operation.


## USB Isolator
We don't want to blow up your computer, so we connect the pico W to the **USB isolator** which then plugs into 
your computer. This way, if the pico ever requests too much current, your computer won't just blindly follow,
the isolator will stop it.

Electrically, the isolator creates a second ground so the computer doesn't have to
share its ground with the pico (and the rest of the circuit) directly.

TLDR, the USB isolator makes sure your computer stays <u>not on fire</u>
