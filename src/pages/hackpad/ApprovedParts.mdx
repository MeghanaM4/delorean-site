## 5V-9V to 170V Boost Converter
To function, IN-12 Nixie tubes need ~170V. Surprisingly, setting up 114 AA batteries is not the most efficient
way to achieve this. There are these neat things called **boost converters** which can (you guessed it) boost
voltage from a reasonable amount, like 5V, to an insane amount, or 170V.

Electrically, there's an inductor inside the boost converter. INSERT TECHNICAL EXPLANATION

## Raspberry Pi Pico W
You may have heard of Raspberry Pis before (spoiler: they're not food), and they're what's called a 
**microcontoller**-- basically just a mini computer.

They can process data and information with the chips they have on board, which act like their brains (the chip 
is usually the big black square). The chip on the pico W is the RP2040. There are a ton of different
chips, all with their own features and pros and cons.

We're using the pico W because it's small (pico) and because it's Wifi-enabled (that's the W
part). So it won't take up too much space and we can connect to the internet to sync our clocks.

TLDR, the pico W is the brains of the operation.


## USB Isolator
We don't want to blow up your computer, so we connect the pico W to the **USB isolator** which then plugs into 
your computer. This way, if the pico ever requests too much current, your computer won't just blindly follow,
the isolator will stop it. 

Electrically, the isolator creates a second ground so the computer doesn't have to
share its ground with the pico (and the rest of the circuit) directly.

TLDR, the USB isolator makes sure your computer stays <u>not on fire</u>
